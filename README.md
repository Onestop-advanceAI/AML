# AML
 One-stop Platform(OSP) enables banks and financial institution to provides Anti-money Laundering(AML) with AML toolkit.

OSP AML toolkit is important to customer's business, especially for their on-boarding processes. First, financial institutions have to protect themselves from risks and meet AML obligations. Thus, these institutions have to perform an extended AML screening to determine their customer risks and response them according to their business rules. Second, customer risks are not static and change over time, and they should be periodically checked and assessed with new actions. 

OPS AML toolkit provides two APIs and one openAPI to screen and monitor a user's risk.
